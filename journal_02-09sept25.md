### Rose
Even though my "data" looks different than most people, I take to heart the lessons about data integrity, data storage, and data retrival. It's not lost on me how important those things are to not just doing research well but productivity. It takes longer when data is harder to find or may have issues, and I want to be a productive researcher.

### Thorn
I feel like a "researcher" but not a "scientist." Sometimes my data is a number. I can use numbers when I'm describing how women entered the workforce as teachers of children while men were able to be professors. But the reason why is not a number, it's a social invention. 

At the core of my research is positivism vs. constructivism. Positivism argues for an objective reality and often makes sense in hard sciences. But constructivism argues that our perception is our reality and meaning and knowledge are created, which is sometimes more difficult to quantify.

### Bud
The organization of data and the searchability are most meaningful to my research at this point. I'm especially learning how important it is to be able to find my own annotations so that I can handle large swaths of information and recall what I need to make the points I need to make when I'm writing the document! Zotero has been helpful for that, but I'm struggling with the Zotero / Kindle lack of connection.

I need to create a Data Management Plan for my research to help us determine how we will provide open access to our data even after the project ends.
