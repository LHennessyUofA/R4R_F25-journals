### Rose

Our research uses box to store data for all the researchers involved. I personally have another folder with all the laboratory techniques and devided by dat whic has allowed me to find the data when I need it easily.

Another aspect of my research project is two GitHub repositories I have created to organize my results, as well as my standard operating procedures. This way, if I need that information, I have it accessible 24/7.


### Thorn

A thorn in my project is that we haven't created a Data Management Plan, meaning each researcher organizes their data independently, and we haven't compiled it into a cohesive document that explains its contents.

### Bud

One thing we want to implement is an open-access data repository where users can simply sign in and download the data, even after the project is completed.

Another factor we need to apply is the Data Management Plan.
