## Rose, Bud, Thorn

Thorn
I feel like a "researcher" but not a "scientist." Sometimes my data is a number. I can use numbers when I'm describing how women entered the workforce as teachers of children while men were able to be professors. But the reason why is not a number, it's a social invention.

At the core of my research is positivism vs. constructivism. Positivism argues for an objective reality and often makes sense in hard sciences. But constructivism argues that our perception is our reality and meaning and knowledge are created, which is sometimes more difficult to quantify.

Bud
The organization of data and the searchability are most meaningful to my research at this point. I'm especially learning how important it is to be able to find my own annotations so that I can handle large swaths of information and recall what I need to make the points I need to make when I'm writing the document! Zotero has been helpful for that, but I'm struggling with the Zotero / Kindle lack of connection.

## Research Application

I have been thinking quite about about the research application for the humanities because it's a bit of a different game. I spoke to my qualitative research professor about data storgae and maintenence, the one who uses One Drive. She said that she is required to keep data for 5 years and the primary reason why was so that there was raw data to reference if a study participant took issue with how they were presented in the study. 

One reason for this difference in the importance of preserving raw data is that qualitative case studies are not meant to be repeated exactly. Not only is it less useful to the field as a whole, but it's relatively impossible. 

This relates back to the difference between positivism and constructivism. When you're dealing with people, you're dealing with reality that is percieved, meaning that is made relationally, and understanding that is constantly changing.

HOWEVER, while I am less likely to be keeping data the same way as hard scientists, I will need to organize it, and I appreciate ideas shared about labels, folders, and general good housekeeping with data.

## Cohort meetup discussion

I had github tutoring for special students and then my cello studio class. I will be hosting the next meetup and will have much more to say.
