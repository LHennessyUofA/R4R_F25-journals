### Rose
It was good to get a refresher on Github and go deeper on version control. I do feel like I better understand the functioning of Github after this class. I spent some time just now making a repository and a branch. In my repository there is a README, a photo in .heic (before I realized that Github doesn't read that file time) a photo in .png, and a file. I created a branch, edited the file and pushed the changes. I tried multiple times to add the photo to the file, but I was unsuccessful. I purpously put the photo in the repsoitory and I am using this code ![Bao Cups](Baocups.png) is it working? 


### Thorn
I am most interested in writing collaboratively with other people and it seems like it's difficult to do it on github. I took the time to learn more about MarkDown, and I saw that I could install an extension that always shows me the preview of the text on the bottom half of the screen. I have also peeked at LaTeX. Still, I'm having a hard time envisioning that I could do something like replace word or google docs with github. I begining to understand that it would be hard to work on the same thing at the same time as another person, and ChatGPT suggested that people could work on different things at the same time to avoid conflicts.

### Bud
This has made me think more deeply about the needs and obsticles of working collaboratively and the benefits of using github. There are some elements of simplicity.
