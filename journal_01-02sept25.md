### Rose 
In general, it's great to learn about open science principles. They align with principles of social justice because they work towards transparency and access. Additionally, we are learning about github and ways to collaborate that allows us to consider ideas while keeping intergity. 

### Thorn 
Many of these skills are very new to me! Though I appreciate that we are getting guidance and practice with github. 

### Bud
I love that on Thursday we got to learn from both an expert and eachother, while we talked about our different needs and approaches to research. I found our guest to be fascinating to listen to whether the specific topic he was speaking on was applicapable to me or not. It felt like an enriching discussion as I learn many things that are new to me.

## Research Application
The recommended resource notebooklm is something that I look forward to applying to my own research and I do anticipate using it. I will see what it can do with data from the North American Schools of Music (an accredidation agency, which does accredit U of A's school of music) and potentially some government documents regarding the funding of string programs in public schools.

Our research can improve the open-access approach by learning how to make the methodologies more transparent, and our research more caring for the communities that are impacted by it.

Improving the way of the version control system, but also starting to get more organized with the analysis and procedures used, so that other researchers can replicate the experiments we do on their own.
