In general, it's great to learn about open science principles. They align with principles of social justice because they work towards transparency and access. Additionally, we are learning about github and ways to collaborate that allows us to consider ideas while keeping intergity.

Many of these skills are very new to me! Though I appreciate that we are getting guidance and practice with github.

I love that on Thursday we got to learn from both an expert and eachother, while we talked about our different needs and approaches to research. I found our guest to be fascinating to listen to whether the specific topic he was speaking on was applicapable to me or not. It felt like an enriching discussion as I learn many things that are new to me.
