### Rose

We are applying Open Science to our research papers produced by my lab group. Our advisor includes the payment for the publication of the paper to ensure it is open access.
  
The Open Methodology, through documenting everything in a GitHub repository, is something I have been using to consolidate all the results and analysis of our data, clearly outlining the procedure used to arrive at the conclusions we reached.


### Thorn

Something my research lacks is a way to get the information to the stakeholders (community members of the affected areas close to mine tailings). I think it is not enough to publish data in open-access journals, as the community members are often people with low incomes, the elderly, or those who could not attend school, making it hard for them to access this kind of information.

Another factor we need to improve is our version control system, as we currently use regular Word documents, but we should enhance our system.


### Bud

I liked the FAIR approach, as it reminds us of all the factors that need to be applied for the research to be considered really as an open-access source for people.
As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, the version control system can be the next step to improve our research documents.

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 8th, 11pm**

Our research can improve the open-access approach by learning how to make the methodologies more transparent, and our research more caring for the communities that are impacted by it.

Improving the way of the version control system, but also starting to get more organized with the analysis and procedures used, so that other researchers can replicate the experiments we do on their own.
