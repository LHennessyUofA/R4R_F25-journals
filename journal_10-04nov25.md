### Rose
It's been interesting to learn about using AI to create agents that can do work for me. I did my best to do the homework which involved installing an API inoto my terminal. I got to the point where I have ./gpt_chat.sh: and that's where I got stuck. I woiuld still have to make an application for the humanities, but with the AI used in qualitative research I don't think it's too hard to do if I were to get more comfortable with the fundamental concept. I have found a certain amount of truth in the idea that I can copy and paste error messages into chatgpt and get decent help. 

### Thorn
At one point I got a repeating error message of "command not found" that continued repeating until I quit terminal. But then I opened it back up and tried again.

### Bud
I have already done more than I have before with my terminal, I look foward to using this information to help myself further integrate AI into my work.
