### Rose
I really like LLMs and will be using them in my work probably more than other tools. I liked learning about ways to make prompts efficient, which includes giving the AI a role to play and outcome specifications. I also appreciated the advice on checking for quality control and mainting the human element. One of my favorite ways to use LLMs is to treat it like "advanced google" where I have ideas about what I'm looking for and I use the LLM to fill in the details. 

### Thorn
One of my biggest frustrations is not be able to use my Kindle books (whicih I have purchased to aid in my research) in LLMs like Notebooklm. I haven't figured out which is faster: Purchasing and scanning the book by hand, working to make the current format (.kfx) to PDF, or just giving up on this, though I don't want to let "the man" win.


### Bud
I was able to use ChatGPT to eventually find the .kfx files (THAT I HAVE PURCHASED) by generating code that I could then use in terminal to find the secret location on my computer. This process better acquainted me to understanding the map of content in my computer and searching within it. I still feel pretty determined to put my favorite books in Notebooklm regardless of the path this takes. I want to put by "Building Access: Universial Design and the Politics of Disability" in it for my dissertation work and for my comps, I will probably end up scaning the dinosaur of a book called "Great Cellists" so that I can listen to a podcast. I wonder if I can get it to add critical comentary about how the "Great Cellists" book buys into the "great man" theory.
