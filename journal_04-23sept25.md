### Rose
I really like LLMs and will be using them in my work probably more than other tools. I liked learning about ways to make prompts efficient, which includes giving the AI a role to play and outcome specifications. I also appreciated the advice on checking for quality control and mainting the human element. One of my favorite ways to use LLMs is to treat it like "advanced google" where I have ideas about what I'm looking for and I use the LLM to fill in the details. 

### Thorn
One of my biggest frustrations is not be able to use my Kindle books (whicih I have purchased to aid in my research) in LLMs like Notebooklm. I haven't figured out which is faster: Purchasing and scanning the book by hand, working to make the current format (.kfx) to PDF, or just giving up on this, though I don't want to let "the man" win.


### Bud
I was able to use ChatGPT to eventually find the .kfx files (THAT I HAVE PURCHASED) by generating code that I could then use in terminal to find the secret location on my computer. This process better acquainted me to understanding the map of content in my computer and searching within it. I still feel pretty determined to put my favorite books in Notebooklm regardless of the path this takes. I want to put by "Building Access: Universial Design and the Politics of Disability" in it for my dissertation work and for my comps, I will probably end up scaning the dinosaur of a book called "Great Cellists" so that I can listen to a podcast. I wonder if I can get it to add critical comentary about how the "Great Cellists" book buys into the "great man" theory.

## Research Application

Thursday's class was such an interesting deep dive into LLMs. Both Thursdays class and the meet-up convinced me that I should spend more time on Gemini and less time on ChatGPT. I am particularly interested in using Notebooklm. I am glad to know that Uof A students get 50 documents to upload. I'm also interested in the LLM Deep Research. I am currently experienmenting with various deep research tools to help me better understand constructivism in education and source papers that I can use to make my own dissertation more robust. I expect to use AI to help me research women in the workforce in the mid-20th century, the mid twentieth-century American middle class and the public funding of string programs. These tools are really perfect for tackling these large-scale ideas.

## Cohort meetup discussion
I attended the meet-up this week and I learned from Lordes about how helpful Gemini has been, and it convinced me to spend my time working on it. In our meet-up discussion we talked about research and how the University system rewards positive results and punishes negative results, even though negative results are just as useful to the greater scientific community. We talked about p-hacking and wished for a system that supported the objectivity and neutrality that we are trained to embrace as researchers.
