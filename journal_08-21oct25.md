### Rose
It's important to know about HPCs and how they work, and I did enjoy that about the lesson. There's a lot of concepts about how they are structured and how the process of using them is structured that I would not have otherwise known without Tuesday's lesson. 

### Thorn
I'm one of the ones that is highly unlikely to use it. My data just doesn't require power. Especially in a bounded, small case study!

### Bud
Knowing about resources and how they work is a form of liberation, and I'm still thankful for this learning.
