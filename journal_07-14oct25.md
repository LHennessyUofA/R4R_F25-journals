### Rose 

I can see the importance of containers and their use in research in the humanities. It would allow me to revisit my own process, share with collaborators, and keep my project accessible regardless of updating software. The container would basically be an "interperative environment" that features any software I used to assist in reaching conclusions, and that makes the reproducibility aspect of it extremely valuable.  

### Thorn
The computer skills still feel like a reach for me, however, not insurmountable with these courses and the support of LLMs. 

### Bud

The more I search for AI software that does qualitative research the more I find. The truth is, AI is really good at language and as I get my AI usage off the ground in my research, I can see why it makes incredible sense to use containers to preserve my research process.

## Research Application
I am going to be using AI to transcribe some interviews for me that are on YouTube. Additionally, I'll be using it to help with analyzing some cello treatises for themes of constructivism. I can use a container to save the versions of software I use and their dependencies.
