### Rose
It was nice to get an introduction to cyverse, which such an important platform at the University of Arizona and beyond, since the cyverse allows for collaboration outside the university as well. There are some capacities in which cyverse reminds me of github, though of course cyverse can be used to do so much more. 

### Thorn
Most of the Apps are jupyter, which I have never used. My data is not often numbers. 

### Bud
I can absolutely see the potential in cyverse. I would love to see a version that is expanded to include tools that researchers in the humanities can use and that allows for qualitative and interperative types of data.
