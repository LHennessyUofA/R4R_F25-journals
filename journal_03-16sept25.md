### Rose
This lesson has given me so much to think about. I've considered how this relates to my research, and I have two answers:

1.) First of all, this lesson has fundamental importance. If I am going to understand how to talk to LLMs in a way that most advantageously uses time and effort and gives me quality reponses, I need to know how computers "understand" us. I especially find this to be a valuable way of understanding because I see myself using LLMs more than other tools to help me identify trends / interact with documents. In summary, I see myself less likely to write code and navigate a shell and more likely to use the knowledge of how computers are mapped out and interact with commands. I'm learning computer epistemology.

2.) This lesson related to my actual research in a way that I didn't expect. I have a learning disability called dyscalculia and the maps we were navigating were difficult for me to visualize without a visual. It's the same blank brain I get if i'm tasked with doing math in my head or listening to a rhythm that I am then asked to notate. I decided to use an LLM (ChatGPT) to restructure the CyVerse lesson content using a pedagogical framework that might be more accessible to me. Just doing this as an exercise helped me to better understand the lesson.

I tasked the LLM with using Spiral Design, which is a type of Backwards Design, which is inspired by the Gestalt psychology principal, "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts." Spiral design starts with the most fundamental concepts and continually revisits them, each time adding more detail and depth. This is a constructivist concept, since it designs around the learnign needs of the user, including the needs for repetition and review. My research is almost entirely about constructivist pedagogy and design. 

### Thorn
I still feel quite novice, but reviewing the materials did help. I do not see my self using an acutal shell, but I can understand the importance of today's hands-on practice in understanding fundamentals of computer communication.

### Bud
Shell helps with LLMs, and in a strange, circular moment, I was able to use an LLM to help me better understand shell. I was able to put principles of my research topic into practice and watch content transform with the help of a constructivist pedagogical framework that centers access in design.
