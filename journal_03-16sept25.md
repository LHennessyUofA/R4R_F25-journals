### Rose
In my research, I've needed to have sme sense of working with the shell when I want to set up the environments to work with Python and VSCode.

### Thorn
 It is not something I do very often, so I have forgotten some of the details, particularly how to set up my environments.

### Bud
It would be beneficial for my research if I need to use HPC, so I can provide the necessary instructions for the code I want to run.

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 22nd, 11pm**
In my research, we need to know how to communicate with computers, as many programs require users to set them up through the shell. For example, SIXPACK begins by opening the shell first. Still, you don't mess up with that one; thankfully, it provides a nice interface for us to analyze our data.
I want to practice setting up my Python environments and configuring VSCode again. I already have it, but I set it up years ago, and I haven't created a new environment since then.

One thing I wonder about is whether it's acceptable to work in the same environment FOREVER. Am I overloading this environment with lots of different tools?

## Cohort meetup discussion

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Thursday 25th, 11am**
>
During our super nice cohort meet-up, which was a tie-dye activity organized by Lory and Gabe on campus, we discussed some of these topics:
- How some research require more computational help than others
- How some PIs are hesitant to the fact of having everything in their research "open source", like the codes, because of the fear of plagiarism.
- Some PIs don't pay for the "open source" fee for the papers they publish because they don't have enough funding, so in the end, the user of the paper is the one who needs to pay a fee to be able to read that paper.

Thanks to Lori and Gabe for coming up with such great idea!
