### Rose
This lesson has given me so much to think about. I've considered how this relates to my research, and I have two answers:

1.) First of all, this lesson has fundamental importance. If I am going to understand how to talk to LLMs in a way that most advantageously uses time and effort and gives me quality reponses, I need to know how computers "understand" us. I especially find this to be a valuable way of understanding because I see myself using LLMs more than other tools to help me identify trends / interact with documents. In summary, I see myself less likely to write code and navigate a shell and more likely to use the knowledge of how computers are mapped out and interact with commands. I'm learning computer epistemology.

2.) This lesson related to my actual research in a way that I didn't expect. I have a learning disability called dyscalculia and the maps we were navigating were difficult for me to visualize without a visual. It's the same blank brain I get if i'm tasked with doing math in my head or listening to a rhythm that I am then asked to notate. I decided to use an LLM (ChatGPT) to restructure the CyVerse lesson content using a pedagogical framework that might be more accessible to me. Just doing this as an exercise helped me to better understand the lesson.

I tasked the LLM with using Spiral Design, which is a type of Backwards Design, which is inspired by the Gestalt psychology principal, "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts." Spiral design starts with the most fundamental concepts and continually revisits them, each time adding more detail and depth. This is a constructivist concept, since it designs around the learnign needs of the user, including the needs for repetition and review. My research is almost entirely about constructivist pedagogy and design. 

### Thorn
I still feel quite novice, but reviewing the materials did help. I do not see my self using an acutal shell, but I can understand the importance of today's hands-on practice in understanding fundamentals of computer communication.

### Bud
Shell helps with LLMs, and in a strange, circular moment, I was able to use an LLM to help me better understand shell. I was able to put principles of my research topic into practice and watch content transform with the help of a constructivist pedagogical framework that centers access in design.

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 22nd, 11pm**
> I still believe the most valuable research application will likely be knowledge about how computers work that will help me to better use LLMs. LLMs tend to help me be a more efficient researcher. Sometimes I use them to clarify my understanding of how historical events unfolded and influenced eachother and find places to dig into more deelply in my own research. Occasionaly I use them to make sure I'm using a framework of theory correctly, and that guides what literature I might choose to futher my undersanding. Knowing how to interact with computers to gain the most helpful information is important for me.
>
> I can also see using AI to create and scan transcripts of recorded lessons and masterclasses (or even PDFs of books) and identify language that is positivist (deficit-based) vs. constructivist (asset-based). My previous interactions with LLMs makes me think that this is possible, though I'm not sure if it would make sense to use something like phython to do this.


## Cohort meetup discussion

> [!IMPORTANT]

> **Due Thursday 25th, 11am**
>
> At the meet-up we talked about faculty and their perception of AI and open science. I currently straddle two parts of my field--peformance and education. The education side is much more "modern" than the performance side. Music educators are social scientists that engage in research and discorse at a much different level than performers. There's even a journal for music education researchres by the May Day Group called "Action, Criticism, and Theory." This side of the field is much more likely to engage with AI and welcome it as a research partner. I also think this part of the field would agree with open science and CARE principles. It overlaps with social justice, which is often a topic of interest. 
>
> In the word of performance, the studio teachers (those who give one-on-one lessons) tend to engage in music theory (an objective approach to understanding music) and musicology (music history, presented as objective and lacking critical perspective). I can see them using AI tools to analyize music from a more positivist perspective, especially since people dedicate entire lives and careers to doing things like analyizing cadences in the Bach chorales and then calculating compositional traits. On a granular level, it sucks out all the joy. In a broad sense, it is absolutely helpful to know more about a compositional trend. Maybe it's a unique cadence in more than one way and that should inform the presentation of the music.
