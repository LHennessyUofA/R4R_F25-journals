### Rose
Because this is somewhat out of my wheelhous in terms of the specific tools we used in class, there are lessons that I believe are important. The humanities verson of reproducibility are things like transparency, methodological rigor, and (my favorite) transferrability. I used ChatGPT to help me relate this to the humanities and I learned quite a few things. 

1. Software for qualitative coding: NVivo, ATLAS.ti, Dedoose, MAXQDA
2. I could be transparent about organizational schema like categories and memos
3. I can be transparent about how artifacts and field notes are imported and organized.
4. I can be transparent about the reseacher's positionality (to a greater degree than is typically done).

Additonally, it mentioned the way that "Dependencies" are similar to a qualitative coder depending on things like emergent categories and assumptions about power and language. It recommended a methods appendix that lists software, frameworks, positionality statements, and analytic choices.

### Thorn
I will probably never make a software environment unless it's for my own amusment.


### Bud
Transparency is an overarching goal of open science and it really seems like the way this unit relates to my work in the humanities is transparency (becusae replication isn't a thing in the same way). However this gives me ideas about ways to be transparent about a research process. From ChatGPT "while a computing environment is about packages and versions, a qualitative research environment could be thought of as the ecosystem of interpretive tools, frameworks, and positionalities that shape knowledge production."
