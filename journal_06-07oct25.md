### Rose
Because this is somewhat out of my wheelhous in terms of the specific tools we used in class, there are lessons that I believe are important. The humanities verson of reproducibility are things like transparency, methodological rigor, and (my favorite) transferrability. I used ChatGPT to help me relate this to the humanities and I learned quite a few things. 

1. Software for qualitative coding: NVivo, ATLAS.ti, Dedoose, MAXQDA
2. I could be transparent about organizational schema like categories and memos
3. I can be transparent about how artifacts and field notes are imported and organized.
4. I can be transparent about the reseacher's positionality (to a greater degree than is typically done).

Additonally, it mentioned the way that "Dependencies" are similar to a qualitative coder depending on things like emergent categories and assumptions about power and language. It recommended a methods appendix that lists software, frameworks, positionality statements, and analytic choices.

### Thorn
I will probably never make a software environment unless it's for my own amusment.


### Bud
Transparency is an overarching goal of open science and it really seems like the way this unit relates to my work in the humanities is transparency (becusae replication isn't a thing in the same way). However this gives me ideas about ways to be transparent about a research process. From ChatGPT "while a computing environment is about packages and versions, a qualitative research environment could be thought of as the ecosystem of interpretive tools, frameworks, and positionalities that shape knowledge production."


## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 8th, 11pm**
>
> My current research essentially deals with identifying constructivism vs. positism in treatises and other published documents on cello teaching. I can see using software to help me do that. In that case, perhaps I would either make a software environment or at the very least be transparent about what tools I used.

## Cohort meetup discussion

In the cohort discussion we talked about the way that professors approach software as deficit based vs. asset based. When it's deficit based, the student is the one who ahs to learn the professor's way and there isn't much consideration for the student's needs either in that moment or in the future. Chideara brought up the point that if she returns to Africa, there is unlikely to be a budget for expensive software and Saka brought up "cracked" software as the current alternative.
